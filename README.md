# Spring Boot CRUD Application with Hibernate with JPA
This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot framework. It utilizes JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for database operations. The application provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations on Category and Product entities.

# Requirements
- Spring Boot: Utilized for building the application.
- Rest Controller: RESTful endpoints are implemented using Spring's @RestController.
- Database Configuration: Configured with RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) instead of in-memory database.
- Annotation-based Configuration: Application configurations are done using annotations rather than XML.
- JPA & Hibernate: Hibernate is used as the JPA provider for database interactions.

  # Outputs:
  - Postman was used for testing the API endpoints. Screenshots of sample requests and responses are provided below:
